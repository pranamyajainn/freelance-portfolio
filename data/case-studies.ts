# Capture Every High-Intent B2B Lead on Reddit. 24/7.

**While you sleep, your competitors are stealing your customers. We stop them.**

## The Situation

Right now, your ideal buyers are asking for your solution on Reddit, Slack, and Discord.

They are describing their exact problems. They are asking for recommendations.

**And you are invisible.**

Manual monitoring is broken. A human can’t watch 12 communities, 24 hours a day. You see 10% of the opportunities. You miss the other 90%.

By the time you reply 6 hours later, the thread is dead. The lead is gone.

## The Guide: Omnipresence

We custom-built an automated Lead Intelligence Agent that monitors your niche 24/7/365.

It doesn’t sleep. It doesn’t blink. It doesn’t miss.

**How It Works:**
- **Instantly Detects**: Scans targeted communities for high-intent keywords in real-time.
- **Intelligently Responds**: Uses Google Gemini to draft helpful, context-aware replies that respect community norms.
- **Deterministically Filters**: Zero spam. Zero noise. Only active buyers.
- **Automatically Logs**: Every interaction is tracked in a centralized dashboard for your sales team.

## The Result: 100% Coverage

We deployed this for a B2B SaaS client. The transformation was immediate.

- **Response Time:** Slashed from **4 hours** to **4 minutes**.
- **Missed Opportunities:** Reduced to **Zero**.
- **Hiring Cost:** Saved **90 minutes/day** of senior staff time (approx. $25k/year savings).

The client didn’t just get "leads." They established **market dominance**. Every time a prospect asked a question, this brand was the first, most helpful answer.

## The Proof

Don’t take our word for it. Watch the system operate in real-time.

# Stop Losing Deals to Faster Competitors.

**Your manual prospecting is too slow. We built a machine that finds every funded company the moment they have cash.**

## The Situation

A company raises $20M in Series B funding. They post 15 new jobs.
They are ready to buy *now*.

**But you don’t know yet.**

By the time your BD team finds them on LinkedIn three days later, your competitor has already closed the deal.

## The Problem: Human Speed

Your team wastes **10+ hours a week** manually refreshing TechCrunch, Crunchbase, and LinkedIn.
- They miss key updates.
- They get tired.
- They operate on "luck" instead of logic.

Every hour they spend searching is an hour they *aren't* selling.

## The Solution: The Smart Lead Radar

We built an Intelligence Engine that monitors the entire web for buying signals. **It finds leads before they are "leads."**

**How It Works:**
- **Watches Everything**: Scrapes funding news, job boards, and API signals 24/7.
- **Filters Ruthlessly**: Only alerts you to companies matching your *exact* ICP (industry, size, role).
- **Delivers Daily**: You wake up to a spreadsheet of 15-30 hot, qualified prospects.

## The Result: An Unfair Advantage

We installed this for a Hiring Agency. The results were instant:

- **Volume**: **15-30** high-intent leads delivered every single morning.
- **Efficiency**: **Zero** hours spent on manual research.
- **Speed**: They are now the **first** to reach out, every single time.

## The Proof

Stop hoping for leads. Start manufacturing them.

# Don't Pitch Your Vision. Prove It.

**Investors see 100 slide decks a week. They ignore 99. We are building the system that makes you the 1.**

> **Status: Active Build.** We are currently engineering this system live.

## The Situation

You have a great thesis. You have a beautiful deck. You have a vision.
**So does everyone else.**

Investors don't fund claims. They fund capabilities.
When you say "We will use AI to qualify leads," they hear "We hope we can figure that out."

## The Problem: The "Trust Me" Gap

Oxiom is raising capital. But their core value prop—complex AI lead qualification—sounds like science fiction in a slide deck.
- Abstract flowcharts look nice.
- They don't prove execution.
- Doubt kills deals.

## The Solution: The "LeadForge" Engine

We aren't building a prototype. **We are building the real machine.**
In a 4-week sprint, we are spinning up a live, end-to-end outcome generator.

**The System We Are Engineering:**
- **Conversation, Not Forms**: A live Telegram bot that chats with prospects naturally.
- **Enrichment, Not Guesses**: Instantly pulling data from Tami AI and Apollo.
- **Decisions, Not Black Boxes**: AI that explains *exactly* why a lead was qualified, in plain English.

## The Goal: Certainty

When an investor asks, "Can you really automate this?"
Oxiom won't accept "Maybe." **They will pull up the live dashboard.**

- **Input**: A raw lead.
- **Process**: Watched in real-time.
- **Output**: A qualified, enriched, scored opportunity.

The conversation shifts from "Is this possible?" to **"How fast can we scale?"**

## The Proof

We are building this in the open.
*(Coming Soon: Live video of the investor demo)*

**Stop asking for belief. Start demanding investment.**
