# Community Response Agent for B2B Lead Discovery

Precision monitoring replaced reactive posting.

## The Situation

Your ideal customers are asking for help right now. On Reddit. In Slack communities. In Discord channels.

Every hour, dozens of threads appear where someone describes the exact problem your product solves. Manual monitoring means you see 10% of these threads. You miss the rest. Your competitors respond faster.

B2B brands need presence in these spaces. Timing determines outcomes. Miss the window by 6 hours and the thread is dead.

## The Problem

A senior team member spends 90 minutes daily scanning subreddits. They search keywords. Filter spam. Evaluate relevance. Draft responses. Log activity.

This work is necessary. It is also repetitive and error-prone.

Result: inconsistent coverage, missed opportunities, expensive labor on mechanical tasks.

The real cost: conversations with active buyers that never happen.

## The System

We built an automated lead generation workflow that operates 24/7.

**Core Functions**
- Continuous scan of targeted subreddits for defined keyword triggers
- AI-generated responses calibrated to community norms
- Spam avoidance through behavioral pattern analysis
- Centralized activity logging in Google Sheets
- Duplicate detection and relevance scoring

**Technology Foundation**
- **n8n**: Workflow orchestration and scheduling
- **Reddit API**: Real-time thread monitoring
- **Google Gemini**: Context-aware response generation
- **Google Sheets**: Lead tracking and analysis database

The system reads context, generates appropriate responses, and logs every interaction. No manual intervention required.

## The Outcome

**Operational Impact**
- Zero engagement windows missed
- Response time reduced from hours to minutes
- 100% activity documentation for analysis
- Spam risk eliminated through deterministic filters

**Business Value**
The client shifted senior time from monitoring to strategy. Every relevant thread now receives timely engagement. Lead tracking became systematic instead of anecdotal.

Community presence transformed from reactive to controlled.

## The Proof

Live workflow demo available. Operational Google Sheet shows lead capture history. System runs continuously without supervision.

This is not a growth hack. This is leverage through automation.

# Automated Lead Intelligence for Hiring Agencies

Manual lead chasing consumed time. Automation returned it.

## The Situation

A company raises $20M in Series B funding. Within weeks, they post 15 open positions. This is a qualified lead. You need to reach them before your competitors do.

But you found this lead by luck, not system. Three other companies raised funding this week. You missed them all.

Hiring agencies need systematic intelligence gathering, not reactive scanning.

## The Problem

Your BD team spends 2+ hours daily hunting leads across:
- TechCrunch funding announcements
- LinkedIn company updates  
- Indeed/LinkedIn job postings
- Crunchbase alerts
- Industry newsletters

They gather leads manually. Quality varies. Coverage has gaps. Response time lags behind agencies with better systems.

The underlying issue: no systematic intelligence pipeline. Just human effort and hope.

## The System

We deployed an automated lead radar that delivers qualified prospects daily.

**Intelligence Gathering**
- Scrapes funding announcement platforms for capital raises
- Monitors job board APIs for hiring intent signals
- Tracks LinkedIn company updates for expansion indicators
- Applies industry and geography filters
- Ranks leads by hiring probability score

**Delivery Mechanism**
- Structured daily reports to Google Sheets
- Lead scoring with clear reasoning
- Contact enrichment where available
- Deduplicated against existing pipeline

**Technology Stack**
- **n8n**: Workflow automation and data orchestration
- **Web Scraping APIs**: Multi-source data collection
- **Google Sheets**: Lead database and CRM integration
- **Custom scoring logic**: Hiring intent algorithms

The system runs overnight. Teams receive prioritized leads each morning.

## The Outcome

**Time Recovered**
Business development hours shifted from research to outreach. Manual list building eliminated. Lead quality improved through systematic filtering.

**Pipeline Impact**
- Daily delivery of 15-30 qualified prospects
- Geographic and industry targeting precision
- Clear hiring intent signals attached to each lead
- Zero hours spent on manual prospecting

The agency now operates from a position of abundance, not scarcity.

## The Proof

Working Google Sheet with months of lead history. Scraping workflows demonstrate real-time data capture. Client reports consistent pipeline growth.

This is not convenience. This is competitive advantage through intelligent automation.

# ICP-to-Qualified-Leads Engine for Investor Validation

> **Project Status**: Currently in active development. Proof artifacts and demonstration videos will be available upon project completion.

Strategic proof replacing abstract promises.

## The Context

Oxiom needs credible proof of its core thesis for investor conversations. Abstract demos fail. Working systems win.

The challenge: building an end-to-end ICP to qualified leads engine that investors can see operating in real time.

**Purpose**: Investor demonstration and fundraising leverage  
**Timeline**: 4 weeks from requirements to working MVP  
**Investment**: Strategic build for equity positioning

## The Challenge

Without a live system, investor conversations stay theoretical. Slide decks explain concepts. Working products prove capability.

Oxiom requires:
- Conversational ICP capture that feels natural, not like a form
- Deterministic AI qualification with readable reasoning
- Transparent data provenance
- Human approval layer for quality control
- Clean CRM export to standard tools
- Investor-focused UI for walkthrough presentations

The system needs to feel inevitable, not experimental.

## The Response

We are building a complete lead qualification engine across five integrated phases.

### Phase 1: Conversational ICP Capture

**Interface Options**
- Telegram bot for natural conversation flow
- Lightweight web UI for guided capture
- No rigid forms or intimidating surveys

**Data Collection**
The system asks strategic questions. It adapts based on responses. It extracts ICP parameters through guided dialogue.

Target industries, company size, decision maker roles, pain points, budget signals. All captured conversationally.

### Phase 2: Lead Enrichment

**Enrichment Pipeline**
- **Tami AI**: Contact verification and enrichment
- **Apollo**: Company data and technographic signals
- **Custom logic**: Data normalization and validation

Raw ICP data transforms into actionable lead intelligence. Missing fields get filled where possible. Confidence scores attach to enriched data.

### Phase 3: AI-Powered Qualification

**Qualification Engine**
The system evaluates each enriched lead against defined criteria. Decision logic operates deterministically, not as a black box.

**Scoring Dimensions**
- ICP fit score with breakdown
- Buying intent signals
- Authority and budget indicators
- Timing and urgency factors

Every qualification decision includes readable reasoning. Investors see why leads pass or fail thresholds.

### Phase 4: Human Approval Layer

Automation enables humans, not replaces them. The system presents qualified leads with full context. Reviewers approve or reject with one click.

This layer ensures quality. It provides learning data for model improvement. It gives stakeholders control.

### Phase 5: CRM Export and Investor Demo UI

**Export Capabilities**
- Airtable integration for pipeline management
- Google Sheets for flexible analysis
- Standard CSV for any CRM

**Investor Walkthrough Interface**
Clean micro-UI designed for presentation. Shows:
- Live ICP capture demonstration
- Real-time enrichment process
- Qualification logic visualization
- Approved lead outputs
- System performance metrics

The interface turns abstract capability into tangible proof.

## Expected Outcomes

Oxiom will gain repeatable investor leverage.

**What the System Will Deliver**
- Working end-to-end lead qualification engine
- Transparent decision logic for technical diligence
- Live demonstration capability for investor meetings
- Verified lead outputs proving concept validity
- Clear data provenance for compliance questions

**Anticipated Fundraising Impact**
Investor conversations will shift from "can you build this?" to "how fast can you scale this?"

The MVP will demonstrate execution capability. It will prove market understanding. It will show technical depth without requiring technical explanations.

## Project Completion & Proof

**Artifacts Available Upon Completion**
- Operational MVP accessible for demonstration
- Investor walkthrough UI with recorded sessions
- Demo scripts for presentation consistency
- Verified lead outputs with qualification reasoning
- System architecture documentation
- Video demonstration of the complete system

This is not a prototype. This is executed proof in progress.

The difference between pitching an idea and demonstrating capability: investor confidence.
